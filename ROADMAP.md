# Roadmap

This document outlines the future development plans for Goatway.

## Planned Features & Improvements

- [ ] **Add Testing**: Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure reliability.
- [ ] **Dockerfile for Portability**: Create a Dockerfile to containerize the application for easy deployment across different environments.
- [ ] **Refactor Project Structure**: Restructure the codebase to support a plugin/provider architecture, allowing easy addition of any LLM provider (not just OpenRouter).
- [ ] **Azure OpenAI Support**: Add support for Azure OpenAI models as a proof-of-concept for the new provider architecture.
- [ ] **CI/CD Pipeline**: Establish a pipeline for automated building, testing, and publishing to enable usage from anywhere.
- [ ] **Web UI for Setup**: Develop a minimal web-based user interface (in a separate repository) to assist users with the initial setup and configuration.
