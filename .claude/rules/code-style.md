# File Size & Organization
- Target keeping all code files under 120 lines whenever possible.
- Files may exceed 120 lines in worst-case scenarios, but can NEVER exceed 150 lines.
- If a file approaches these limits, split it into smaller modules.
- One file should have one clear responsibility. Avoid mixing unrelated functionality.
